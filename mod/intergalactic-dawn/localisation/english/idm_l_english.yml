  idm_origin_comunist: "Communism"
  idm_origin_comunist_desc: "Concepts such as private property and social hierarchy have never found a place in the history of this civilization. From its origin, they have organized themselves as a horizontal community where power is exercised through direct democracy or elected committees. The means of production and wealth belong to those who produce: the working class."

  idm_origin_speedy: "The Speed Legacy"
  idm_origin_speedy_desc: "The Speed species has at its core a deep reverence for extreme racing and the vehicles that make it possible. They develop groundbreaking technologies to propel their vehicles to astonishing speeds. Their knowledge of hyper-advanced engines, steering systems, and propulsion systems is unparalleled."
  idm_start_screen_origin_speedy: "Eons ago, our civilization emerged, a unique species composed of fearless beings whose destiny was intertwined with an insatiable passion for speed and adrenaline. Our Speed ancestors initiated the first high-speed races. It was in the plains, valleys, and volcanoes of our beloved world that our culture of extreme racing originated.\n\nThroughout the eons, we adopted unique racing styles and continually improved them as we developed increasingly incredible vehicles. Initially, we competed in land vehicles, gliding across arid plains in custom-made hovercraft. Later, we ventured into the skies in aircraft specially designed for extreme speed. Ultimately, we dared to conquer cosmic altitudes, facing the perils of deep space in spacecraft adapted for frenetic space races.\n\nNow, having discovered the hyperlane network, we are ready to depart from the gravitational pull of our mother star, and only destiny knows the new worlds awaiting us throughout the galaxy. We are eager to race!"

  idm_pm_ultra_rich: "Exceptional Quality Minerals"
  idm_pm_ultra_rich_desc: "The exceptional quality of minerals in this planet's crust provides a truly incredible mining opportunity."

  idm_origin_miners: "Exotic Mines"
  idm_origin_miners_desc: "Born in a mineral-rich world, we have mastered the art of extraction. Our empire thrives as mineral abundance is our lifeblood."

  idm_possible_origin_miners: "Have species type: $LITHOID$"
  idm_start_screen_origin_miners: "In our odyssey through the cosmos, we embrace our calling for mining, a force that shapes our journey.\n\nThe ancient arid planet, once our home, can no longer contain us. Stagnation looms, and we know we must seek the future or be overtaken by it.\n\nIn the Abyss, we find relics of a mysterious world. We turn wreckage into technological advancements, preparing for the next phase. We will explore, learn, and protect.\n\nOur empire, molded by mining, will lead. We will extract essential resources while ensuring a prosperous future. With courage, we will face cosmic challenges. Each mined asteroid will lead us to our ascent in the vastness of the universe."

  idm_origin_spies: "Counterintelligence"
  idm_origin_spies_desc: "This civilization is obsessed with counterintelligence, harboring an almost irrational fear of being manipulated by alien interests. Only a nation free from interference in its internal affairs can be truly free and independent."
  idm_start_screen_origin_spies: "Our civilization is shaped by a profound mistrust of external forces and possesses an unwavering determination to maintain our sovereignty at any cost. From the earliest steps in our history, we have developed a mindset of constant vigilance, believing that even the slightest alien interference can compromise our freedom and autonomy.\n\nWe have highly developed counterintelligence agencies where spies and undercover agents work tirelessly to protect the nation's secrets and integrity. After all, alien conspiracies lurk in every corner, and the only way to preserve our true independence is to maintain strict control over our internal affairs. Especially now, with the discovery of the hyperlane network, which represents the possibility of encountering other civilizations."

  idm_origin_mercenaries: "Militias"
  idm_origin_mercenaries_desc: "In this society, a significant portion of public security and military defense is carried out through the initiative of the civilian population itself. The state encourages the sale of firearms and ammunition to all its citizens in a very accessible manner. The recruitment of units for the armed forces is much easier, allowing them to assemble numerous armies and fleets; however, since they are not professional, their fleets tend to be weaker."
  idm_start_screen_origin_mercenaries: "We have always valued autonomy and individual freedom above all else. Every citizen has the right to bear firearms from an early age, with few restrictions. This has led to a culture where the concept of self-defense is widely accepted but has also resulted in frequent conflicts due to the misuse of firearms.\n\nThroughout our history, we have not developed centralized armed forces. Instead, we rely on a series of independent militias. Each community, city, or region has its own militia, composed of volunteer citizens who organize into armed groups to protect their communities and interests.\n\nOf course, the easy availability of firearms and the culture of individualism have led to frequent episodes of violence. Conflicts between neighboring communities, territorial disputes, and personal disagreements have often resulted in armed confrontations. Despite the lack of a professional army, these independent militias play a central role in these conflicts.\n\nBut where external observers may see barbarism, we see strength and honor. Thanks to this fierce martial competition, our society has managed to advance technologically and reach the space age. Now, united under one flag and a common goal, we have discovered the hyperlane network, which will expand business opportunities and domains to new worlds for all our homeland communities.

  idm_events_origin_miners.4.title: "Descendentes não planejados!"
  idm_events_origin_miners.4.desc: "Depois de muito tempo debatendo a descoberta do Descompressor de Matéria no sistema [From.GetStarName] a nossa comunidade científica chegou a uma conclusão disruptiva, mas que foi confirmada após construirmos nossa base-estelar no sistema: seja lá qual foi a civilização que construiu o Descompressor de Matéria, ela também usou nosso planeta como depósito para a produção em escala galáctica de minerais gerada do Buraco Negro, o que muito provavelmente foi decisivo para gerar as formas de vida que milhões de anos depois deram origem a nós. A teoria foi confirmada depois que, graças ao entreposto que construímos, identificamos materiais na estrutura do Descompressor de Matéria que só deveriam existir em nosso planeta natal.\n\nAgora, se somos frutos de algum tipo de experimento macabro para gerar vida ou se fomos apenas um acidente gerado dos restos de um império avançado há muito esquecido, talvez nunca saberemos!"
  idm_events_origin_miners.4.a: "Intrigante. Bom... Pelo menos vamos tirar alguns minerais disso."
